 Python script designed to process badge images. Users upload an image, which is then verified to meet size and circular cropping requirements. The script enhances the image's colours for a 'happy' feeling and converts it into a PNG format. Leveraging the Pillow (PIL) library for image manipulation, this script offers a standalone solution for creating engaging and visually appealing badge avatars.

This repository demonstrates two aspects of image manipulation. The script 'avatar_processing.py' showcases the correct version, taking 'avatar-male.jpeg' as input, verifying its specifications, and enhancing colors for a 'happy' vibe. The result is stored as 'avatar-badge.png'. Additionally, 'avatar-badge.png' is included to illustrate the potential appearance if an image does not meet the criteria.
